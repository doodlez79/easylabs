High TSH can be a sign of Hashimoto’s Disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause your body to attack the thyroid, damaging its function, which can result in the underproduction of active thyroid hormones and the corresponding overproduction of TSH by the brain, in its attempt to get the thyroid to make more active hormone (­ TSH = ¯thyroid function).</p>\n<p>In any case, remember that your body is giving you clues – all of which are figure-out-able.</p>\n","treatment":"<p><strong>Because the thyroid plays such a powerful role in so many functions in the body, it’s important to first do some more investigative bloodwork and perhaps even imaging (ultrasound) may be indicated if the remaining bloodwork comes back normal.</strong> In the meantime, there are some measures you can adopt to start addressing thyroid health now: include iodine-rich foods such as table salt, seafood, seaweed, egg yolks, and fish such as cod.

Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can also be found from food sources – but typically as a small food fortification (e.g. added to milk products) or from sun-exposed mushrooms.

Vitamin D has signaling effects of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and a suggested role in mitigating the cellular immune response (especially relating to respiratory infections). The innate immune system, which produces pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to acute (respiratory) infections, can be calmed (when overreacting) and modulated as needed by Vitamin D. There is research showing its connection in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid arthritis as well as certain cancers when in deficient levels.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D also plays a role in gut integrity. Gut health is a very important aspect to overall wellbeing and our immune functioning. Vitamin D has a role in properly functioning tight junctions, or the ‘glue sticks’ that hold the intestinal cells together (as well as gap junctions and adherens junctions that also impact gut integrity and function).</p>\n<p>We also see Vitamin D playing a significant role in mental / emotional and cognitive health including links with depression, SAD, anxiety.</p>\n<p>Some Vitamin D studies have also shown improvements in male<br>testosterone levels and the possibility of improving sperm motility.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>Now that you’ve found out you have low Vitamin D, there are a few main ways to consider increasing your blood levels: safely increase sun (or UVB) exposure, increase intake from food sources and increase intake through supplements.</p>\n<p>Since ~<strong>90% of our Vitamin D can be produced by UVB sunshine</strong>, increasing your exposure without burning or damaging your skin may be effective to increase your levels.

So what does this mean?</p>\n<p>Levels closer to the optimal ranges can vary between 125-150 nmol/L or some would consider 100-150 nmol/L optimal. If you are in this range – keep doing what you are doing.</p>\n<p>A low or insufficient Vitamin D level can be due to several factors. First of all, the majority of your Vitamin D is made in the skin through a reaction that turns a cholesterol molecule (7-deoxycholesterol) into Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) through the action of sunlight (or UVB light). Safe sunlight exposure can be very helpful in increasing our Vitamin D levels in the body. However, in climates that are further away from the equator, and therefore get less sunshine for more of the year, the amount of sun may not be enough to keep your vitamin D at optimal levels. We can also intake Vitamin D from food and supplements – so depending on where you are getting your current level of Vitamin D, continue to include these sources.</p>\n<p>As we absorb dietary Vitamin D through our digestive tract, if you have concerns relating to malabsorption (for e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic loose stools, Celiac disease, or other gluten / food intolerances) – this could lead to a low blood Vitamin D. If you have some of these GI related conditions but your Vitamin D is still in the normal or optimal range, talk to your health care provider to regularly check your D status (once per year for e.g.) as well as work on other aspects of digestive health to minimize your risk of under or over doing your Vitamin D intake.</p>\n<p>Some of the conditions that are connected to Vitamin D deficiency include: osteomalacia &amp; osteoporosis, bone fractures, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, infections and more.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that as you continue to work on keeping or optimizing your blood levels of Vitamin D, you have the potential to improve your bone &amp; dental strength, mental health, hormonal balance, and reduce risks for certain cancers, autoimmune and chronic diseases (like MS, Type 1 and 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease etc.).</p>\n<p>As a young woman still in your reproductive years, it’s also important to note that having sufficient vitamin D is very important in pre-conception and prenatal health. Raising your levels up to optimal may benefit a healthier pregnancy (carrying to term, lower risk of C-section, minimizing certain health risks in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia), post-partum health (including mental well-being) as well as baby’s health in utero and longer term.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>Since you have optimal Vitamin D levels, continue to support them through these main ways: safe sun (or UVB) exposure, intake from food sources and intake through supplements.</p>\n<p>Since ~<strong>90% of our Vitamin D can be produced by UVB sunshine</strong>, increasing your exposure without burning or damaging your skin may be effective to increase your levels if needed (even slightly). Even 10-15 minutes of unprotected sun (i.e. no sunscreen or clothing covering at least one part of your skin) may be enough to bring your vitamin D levels into the optimal range. However, as many people work &amp; live indoors most of the day, live in latitudes more than 34° north or south of the equator, or wear a lot of protective sun clothing or sunscreens – it may be difficult to get enough sun throughout the year to keep our Vitamin D levels optimal. How dark our skin pigment is can also impact how much sun is needed to create the optimal level of Vitamin D.</p>\n<p>So, food is one of the main ways to replete and sustain our Vitamin D levels. We can get Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in food from animal sources such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel or sardines), egg yolks, and animal liver (organic / pasture &amp; grass fed ideally).

We also get Vitamin D from food and supplements – so exploring if you are taking in a little too much this way is a good idea.</p>\n<p>To have an elevated or higher normal vitamin D, you may recently be supplementing too much. With your doctor’s advice, you may want to consider pausing your current Vitamin D dose and retest within a week or two to monitor your levels.</p>\n<p>Having high normal Vitamin D levels may be asymptomatic – meaning you may not notice any obvious symptoms. However, there are some symptoms associated with Vitamin D excess or toxicity that you may experience or want to watch for if levels continue to rise: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abnormal heart rhythm, weakness, frequent urination, confusion, apathy, excessive thirst, dehydration and kidney stones.   Keep in mind that these symptoms are extremely unlikely at higher normal levels (usually only seen in toxicity situations).</p>\n<p>Too much vitamin D can lead to an excess or imbalance of blood calcium and phosphate levels. This can occur in a condition called hyperparathyroidism (excess parathyroid activity). If calcium levels are elevated, it can lead to calcification of various soft tissues (including the kidneys and blood vessels), formation of kidney stones, and if very off balance heart irregularities.

Vitamin D has signaling effects of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and a suggested role in mitigating the cellular immune response  (especially relating to respiratory infections). The innate immune system, which produces pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to acute (respiratory) infections, can be calmed (when overreacting) and modulated as needed by Vitamin D. There is research showing its connection in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid arthritis as well as certain cancers when in deficient levels.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D also plays a role in gut integrity. Gut health is a very important aspect to overall wellbeing and our immune functioning. Vitamin D has a role in properly functioning tight junctions, or the ‘glue sticks’ that hold the intestinal cells together (as well as gap junctions and adherens junctions that also impact gut integrity and function).</p>\n<p>We also see Vitamin D playing a significant role in mental / emotional and cognitive health including links with depression, SAD, anxiety.</p>\n<p>Obesity has been shown to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency.

First of all, it’s great that you’ve picked this deficiency up as there are things you can do to change this pattern!</p>\n<p>As you have seen, a low Vitamin D level can be due to several factors. First of all, the majority of your Vitamin D is made in the skin through a reaction that turns a cholesterol molecule (7-deoxycholesterol) into Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) through the action of sunlight (or UVB light). Safe sunlight exposure can be very helpful in increasing our Vitamin D levels in the body. However, in climates that are further away from the equator, and therefore get less sunshine throughout the year, the amount of sun you receive is likely not enough to keep your vitamin D at optimal levels. We can also intake Vitamin D from food and supplements – so you may not be taking in enough Vitamin D from these sources at this time.</p>\n<p>As we absorb dietary Vitamin D through our digestive tract, if you have concerns relating to malabsorption (for e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic loose stools, Celiac disease, or other gluten / food intolerances) – this could lead to a low blood Vitamin D as well.</p>\n<p>Having low Vitamin D levels can be asymptomatic – meaning you may not notice any obvious symptoms of having low levels. However, there are some symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency that you may be experiencing: muscle weakness or cramps, bone &amp; joint pain (especially low back pain), fatigue, depression or mood changes.</p>\n<p>Some of the conditions that are connected to Vitamin D deficiency include: osteomalacia &amp; osteoporosis, bone fractures, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, infections and more.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that as you work toward optimizing your blood levels of Vitamin D, you have the potential to improve your bone &amp; dental strength, mental health, hormonal balance, and reduce risks for certain cancers, autoimmune and chronic diseases (like MS, Type 1 and 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease etc.).</p>\n<p>In the immune system, Vitamin D plays a role in its modulation as well as inflammation. Vitamin D has signaling effects of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and a suggested role in mitigating the cellular immune response  (especially relating to respiratory infections). The innate immune system, which produces pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to acute (respiratory) infections, can be calmed (when overreacting) and modulated as needed by Vitamin D. There is research showing its connection in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid arthritis as well as certain cancers when in deficient levels.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D also plays a role in gut integrity. Gut health is a very important aspect to overall wellbeing and our immune functioning. Vitamin D has a role in properly functioning tight junctions, or the ‘glue sticks’ that hold the intestinal cells together (as well as gap junctions and adherens junctions that also impact gut integrity and function).</p>\n<p>We also see Vitamin D playing a significant role in mental / emotional and cognitive health including links with depression, SAD, anxiety.</p>\n<p>Obesity has been shown to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency. Some researchers believe it has to do with Vitamin D being stored in fat tissues, preventing the active use of it in our bodies. Healthy weight balance may also improve your vitamin D status and how it’s being used in conjunction with other hormone systems.</p>\n<p>There are also benefits of optimal Vitamin D levels in pregnancy for mother and baby. Having sufficient levels has been shown to reduce the chance of pre-eclampsia (by 50%) and Caesarean section (by 75%) and low D levels are connected to more premature births &amp; low birth weight babies.</p>\n<p>As a young woman in your reproductive years, it’s also important to note that having sufficient vitamin D is very important in pre-conception and prenatal health. Raising your levels up to optimal may benefit a healthier pregnancy (carrying to term, lower risk of C-section, minimizing certain health risks in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia), post-partum health (including mental well-being) as well as baby’s health in utero and longer term.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>Now that you’ve found out you have low Vitamin D, there are a few main ways to consider increasing your blood levels: safely increase sun (or UVB) exposure, increase intake from food sources and increase intake through supplements.</p>\n<p>Since ~<strong>90% of our Vitamin D can be produced by UVB sunshine</strong>, increasing your exposure without burning or damaging your skin may be effective to increase your levels. Even 10-15 minutes of unprotected sun (i.e. no sunscreen or clothing covering at least one part of your skin) may be enough to bring your vitamin D levels into the sufficient range. However, as many people work &amp; live indoors most of the day, live in latitudes more than 34° north or south of the equator, or wear a lot of protective sun clothing or sunscreens – it may be difficult to get enough sun throughout the year to keep our Vitamin D levels optimal. How dark our skin pigment is can also impact how much sun is needed to create the optimal level of Vitamin D. It’s important to discuss with your doctor how much direct sun exposure is safe for you and knowing the latitude of where you live.</p>\n<p>Food is another way to replete our D levels. We can get Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in food from animal sources such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel or sardines), egg yolks, and animal liver (organic / pasture &amp; grass fed ideally). Historically, some cultures would have gotten more of these foods in their diet on a semi-regular basis to sustain their vitamin D through the winter time (eg. liver every other week at family dinners). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can also be found from food sources – but typically as a food fortification (e.g. added to milk products) or from sun-exposed mushrooms. However, the amount of Vitamin D naturally occurring in most foods is still quite low and usually insufficient to replete low Vitamin D blood levels.</p>\n<p>Supplementation is one of the most important ways to improve our Vitamin D levels. It can come in varying forms, but the most common and effective source is Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) found in capsules, liquids or products like cod liver oil. Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol) can also be taken but is considered less effective and requires more processing in the body.</p>\n<p>(If very resistant to the above treatments, injectable forms of Vitamin D through your health care provider may also be an option.)</p>\n<p>Newer research also shows that Vitamin D may be degraded (or broken down) in our bodies by the action of a receptor called Pregnane X Receptor (PXR).

Historically, some cultures would have gotten more of these foods in their diet on a semi-regular basis to sustain their vitamin D through the winter time (eg. liver every other week at family dinners). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can also be found from food sources – but typically as a food fortification (e.g. added to milk products) or from sun-exposed mushrooms.</p>\n<p>We can also use supplementation to optimize our Vitamin D levels. It can come in varying forms, but the most common and effective source is Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) found in capsules, liquids or products like cod liver oil.</p>\n<p>(If very resistant to the above treatments, injectable forms of Vitamin D through your health care provider may also be an option.)</p>\n<p>Obesity has been shown to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency. Some researchers believe it has to do with Vitamin D being stored in fat tissues, preventing the active use of it in our bodies. Healthy weight balance may improve or increase your vitamin D status and how it’s being used in conjunction with other hormone systems – so keep an eye on this with your medical support team.</p>\n<p>Newer research also shows that Vitamin D may be degraded (or broken down) in our bodies by the action of a receptor called Pregnane X Receptor (PXR). It can trigger (by attaching to our genes) the CYP24 enzyme to degrade stored or active forms of Vitamin D (25,(OH)D3 or 1,25 (OH)2 D3 respectively) into inactive forms. This PXR receptor, can be activated or triggered by some medications and toxicants from the environment (e.g. BPA or Pesticides). Choosing organic food can reduce your exposure to pesticides. To reduce BPA exposure and intake you can start by eating less packaged foods or food &amp; drinks from plastic containers, and avoiding handling thermal receipts (especially if you use lotion or hand sanitizers on your hands). And while we reduce these types of toxicant exposures, we can also reduce the potential for active or usable forms of Vitamin D to be degraded –  potentially improving our total blood levels and its function.</p>\n<p>The basic RDA for Vitamin D has been changing over the last several years. Where once thought that 400 IU/day was enough, more current recommendations look more around 1-2000 IU/day. Upwards of 10,000 IU/day has generally been considered safe – however, everyone’s needs and use of Vitamin D may differ and monitoring the right dose for you is important through regular follow-up testing by your health care provider.</p>\n<p>Please speak with your healthcare practitioner to explore further testing** and next steps.</p>\n"}},{"id":"56NVRSz7iZxlT0wyYSuy9","type":"borderline","min":75,"max":250,"tooHigh":{"significance":"<p>Vitamin D seems to have many roles in the body – including one of its most well-known functions of strengthening our bones and teeth.

However, there are some symptoms associated with Vitamin D excess or toxicity that you may experience or want to watch for if levels continue to rise: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, abnormal heart rhythm, weakness, frequent urination, confusion, apathy, excessive thirst, dehydration and kidney stones.</p>\n<p>Too much vitamin D can lead to an excess or imbalance of blood calcium and phosphate levels. This can occur in a condition called hyperparathyroidism (excess parathyroid activity). If calcium levels are elevated, it can lead to calcification of various soft tissues (including the kidneys and blood vessels), formation of kidney stones, and if very off balance heart irregularities. Elevated or toxic levels of Vitamin D (usually well above 250 nmol/L) can also lead to a weakening of bones through Vitamin K2 reduction.</p>\n<p>Vitamin 1, 25-dihydroxy Vitamin D (the active Vitamin D hormone) that is converted from 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (what you’ve had measured on your bloodwork) may become too high if there is extra production outside of the kidneys in other more rare conditions.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that as you work toward reducing &amp; optimizing your blood levels of Vitamin D, you have the potential to improve your bone &amp; dental strength, mental health, hormonal balance, and reduce risks for certain cancers, autoimmune and chronic diseases (like MS, Type 1 and 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease etc.).</p>\n<p>As a woman potentially still in your reproductive years, it’s important to note that having sufficient vitamin D is very important in pre-conception and prenatal health.

It also appears to be involved in immune system function (inflammation and acute respiratory illnesses), how insulin is released and regulated from the pancreas, gut integrity, muscle activity and strength, heart and blood pressure regulation, brain function and mental health.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Vitamin D (25, OH D3) came back Normal or Optimal</strong> – congrats!! So what does this mean?</p>\n<p>Levels closer to the optimal ranges can vary between 125-150 nmol/L or some would consider 100-150 nmol/L optimal. If you are in this range – keep doing what you are doing.</p>\n<p>A low or insufficient Vitamin D level can be due to several factors. First of all, the majority of your Vitamin D is made in the skin through a reaction that turns a cholesterol molecule (7-deoxycholesterol) into Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) through the action of sunlight (or UVB light). Safe sunlight exposure can be very helpful in increasing our Vitamin D levels in the body. However, in climates that are further away from the equator, and therefore get less sunshine for more of the year, the amount of sun may not be enough to keep your vitamin D at optimal levels. We can also intake Vitamin D from food and supplements – so depending on where you are getting your current level of Vitamin D, continue to include these sources.</p>\n<p>As we absorb dietary Vitamin D through our digestive tract, if you have concerns relating to malabsorption (for e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic loose stools, Celiac disease, or other gluten / food intolerances) – this could lead to a low blood Vitamin D. If you have some of these GI related conditions but your Vitamin D is still in the normal or optimal range, talk to your health care provider to regularly check your D status (once per year for e.g.) as well as work on other aspects of digestive health to minimize your risk of under or over doing your Vitamin D intake.</p>\n<p>Some of the conditions that are connected to Vitamin D deficiency include: osteomalacia &amp; osteoporosis, bone fractures, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, infections and more.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that as you continue to work on keeping or optimizing your blood levels of Vitamin D, you have the potential to improve your bone &amp; dental strength, mental health, hormonal balance, and reduce risks for certain cancers, autoimmune and chronic diseases (like MS, Type 1 and 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease etc.).</p>\n<p>As a young woman still in your reproductive years, it’s also important to note that having sufficient vitamin D is very important in pre-conception and prenatal health. Raising your levels up to optimal may benefit a healthier pregnancy (carrying to term, lower risk of C-section, minimizing certain health risks in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia), post-partum health (including mental well-being) as well as baby’s health in utero and longer term.</p>\n","treatment":"<p style=\"text-align:start;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Since you have optimal Vitamin D levels, continue to support them through these main ways: safe sun (or UVB) exposure, intake from food sources and intake through supplements.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Since ~<strong>90% of our Vitamin D can be produced by UVB sunshine</strong>, increasing your exposure without burning or damaging your skin may be effective to increase your levels if needed (even slightly). Even 10-15 minutes of unprotected sun (i.e. no sunscreen or clothing covering at least one part of your skin) may be enough to bring your vitamin D levels into the optimal range. However, as many people work &amp; live indoors most of the day, live in latitudes more than 34° north or south of the equator, or wear a lot of protective sun clothing or sunscreens – it may be difficult to get enough sun throughout the year to keep our Vitamin D levels optimal. How dark our skin pigment is can also impact how much sun is needed to create the optimal level of Vitamin D.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">So, food is one of the main ways to replete and sustain our Vitamin D levels. We can get Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in food from animal sources such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel or sardines), egg yolks, and animal liver (organic / pasture &amp; grass fed ideally). Historically, some cultures would have gotten more of these foods in their diet on a semi-regular basis to sustain their vitamin D through the winter time (eg. liver every other week at family dinners). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can also be found from food sources – but typically as a food fortification (e.g. added to milk products) or from sun-exposed mushrooms.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">We can also use supplementation to optimize our Vitamin D levels. It can come in varying forms, but the most common and effective source is Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) found in capsules, liquids or products like cod liver oil.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">(If very resistant to the above treatments, injectable forms of Vitamin D through your health care provider may also be an option.)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Obesity has been shown to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency. Some researchers believe it has to do with Vitamin D being stored in fat tissues, preventing the active use of it in our bodies. Healthy weight balance may improve or increase your vitamin D status and how it’s being used in conjunction with other hormone systems – so keep an eye on this with your medical support team.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Newer research also shows that Vitamin D may be degraded (or broken down) in our bodies by the action of a receptor called Pregnane X Receptor (PXR). It can trigger (by attaching to our genes) the CYP24 enzyme to degrade stored or active forms of Vitamin D (25,(OH)D3 or 1,25 (OH)2 D3 respectively) into inactive forms. This PXR receptor, can be activated or triggered by some medications and toxicants from the environment (e.g. BPA or Pesticides). Choosing organic food can reduce your exposure to pesticides. To reduce BPA exposure and intake you can start by eating less packaged foods or food &amp; drinks from plastic containers, and avoiding handling thermal receipts (especially if you use lotion or hand sanitizers on your hands). And while we reduce these types of toxicant exposures, we can also reduce the potential for active or usable forms of Vitamin D to be degraded –  potentially improving our total blood levels and its function.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">The basic RDA for Vitamin D has been changing over the last several years.

Then, a protein produced by the stomach (called intrinsic factor) combines with B12 and ultimately helps our body absorb B12.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n","treatment":"<p><span style=\"color: rgba(0,0,0,0.87);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12px;font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Having a balanced diet that includes sources of B-12 or taking supplements may help you maintain healthy B12 levels. If your healthcare practitioner decides that you may be experiencing issues with absorbing vitamin B-12 from food sources, then oral supplements or injections may help.

These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Maintaining this optimal cholesterol level reduces your risk for cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and stroke, as well as reducing your risk for gallstones.</p>\n<p>You may have no warning signs that your cholesterol has changed, so even though it is currently optimal, it is recommended to have your cholesterol checked regularly (every 3-5 years).</p>\n","treatment":"<p>Keep your

If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Maintaining this optimal cholesterol level reduces your risk for cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and stroke, as well as reducing your risk for gallstones.</p>\n<p>You may have no warning

If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

At this level, there is no particular cause for concern.  However, we would prefer to prevent it from rising higher.  Maintaining an optimal cholesterol level reduces your risk for cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and stroke, as well as reducing your risk for gallstones.</p>\n<p>You may have no warning signs that your cholesterol has slipped from the above optimal range into the high range, it is recommended to have your cholesterol checked regularly (every 3-5 years) as you may have no other way of knowing that it is high.  If you want to be proactive about your cholesterol, there are some strategies that you can implement to make your level more optimal.</p>\n<p>When total cholesterol levels are high, further tests to determine your cardiovascular disease risk may be helpful.  These include HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, fasting insulin, hsCRP, apo-lipoprotein B, apo-lipoprotein A1, lipoprotein (a) and fasting homocysteine.</p>\n<p>Therapeutic Approaches</p>\n<p>Here are some steps that you can take to help bring your cholesterol level into a more ideal range.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>Beta sitosterols, these are plant sterol compounds.

alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: auto;width: auto\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dietary modifications.  Try to reduce your intake of carbs and sugar and consume a more whole foods, high fiber diet. This helps to lower your intake of foods that increase insulin.  Insulin may cause increased cholesterol production in your liver.</p>\n<p>Regular exercise also reduces insulin which may prevent excessive liver production of cholesterol.</p>\n<p>Fish oil has been shown to lower bad cholesterol (LDL).</p>\n<p>Since as early as 1955, Vitamin B3 or niacin has been known to help lower cholesterol and may help prevent heart disease.</p>\n<p>A few adjustments to your diet and exercise should be all you need to do to optimize your cholesterol level.</p>\n"},"tooLow":{"significance":"<p>Cholesterol is a compound that is made primarily in your liver, but also in your intestines and many other body tissues. It is used in your body as a building block for other important substances like vitamin D, steroid hormones, and bile acids.</p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS8di0tGUxbFMWzALxfUkTx1Yu8zAEHExvSCw&usqp=CAU\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: auto;width: auto\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>A normal cholesterol level is responsible for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity for every cell in your body. If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Bile acids also regulate energy and help to maintain blood sugar balance.</p>\n<p>Given your body's necessity for cholesterol, your liver and intestines work together to ensure a consistent, stable supply of it.</p>\n<p>At 3.1 to 3.8 mmol/L your cholesterol level is slightly below optimal.   While the greater danger lies in having high cholesterol, suboptimal levels may compromise your ability to make important compounds like vitamin D and bile acids.</p>\n<p>Low cholesterol is associated with violent, aggressive, and impulsive behaviour. It has also been associated with bleeding within the tissue of the brain (primary intracerebral hemorrhage), which typically happens in older adults. It also carries a risk for low birth weight or premature birth in pregnant women.  Since your liver is a source of cholesterol, severe liver disease such as hepatitis and cirrhosis may cause low cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p>If your total cholesterol level is low, tests for ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, serum albumin, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol may help determine why your cholesterol is too low.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>If your cholesterol level is low, should you go out and eat lots of burgers and pizza to increase it? Absolutely not! If it is low because you are on cholesterol-lowering medication, always discuss adjustments to your medication with the prescribing doctor.  If your cholesterol level is low because your good cholesterol (HDL) is too low, we know that exercise helps to boost HDL.  Adding regular physical activity may help to bring your HDL and total cholesterol up.</p>\n<img

alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: auto;width: auto\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>A normal cholesterol level is responsible for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity for every cell in your body. If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Bile acids also regulate energy and help to maintain blood sugar balance.</p>\n<p>Given your body's necessity for cholesterol, your liver and intestines work together to ensure a consistent, stable supply of it.</p>\n<p>At greater than 5.2 mmol/L your cholesterol level is high.  While high cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and stroke, as well as increasing your risk for gallstones, it doesn't mean that you will have to suffer these consequences. You may not experience any symptoms of high cholesterol. Alternatively, you may experience the symptoms of the conditions that are associated with high cholesterol such gallstones.  The symptoms of gallstones include pain in your right upper abdomen, particularly after consuming a fatty meal, the pain may radiate to your right shoulder blade.  You may not tolerate greasy foods.  High blood pressure or hypertension may also be a sign that your cholesterol should be checked.</p>\n<p>Sadly, a heart attack or stroke may be the first sign that you have high cholesterol.  For this reason, it is recommended to have your cholesterol checked regularly (every 3-5 years) as you may have no other way of knowing that it is high.  Knowledge is power. Now that you know that your cholesterol is high, you can take measures to bring it down.</p>\n<p>When total cholesterol levels are high, further tests to determine your cardiovascular disease risk may be helpful.  These include HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, fasting insulin, hsCRP, apo-lipoprotein B, apo-lipoprotein A1, lipoprotein (a) and fasting

alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: auto;width: auto\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>A normal cholesterol level is responsible for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity for every cell in your body. If cholesterol levels increase, cell membranes become more stiff and the flow of water and minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cell is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol is also your body's building block to make bile acids.  These are important for digestion and absorption of dietary fats, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Bile acids also regulate energy and help to maintain blood sugar balance.</p>\n<p>Given your body's necessity for cholesterol, your liver and intestines work together to ensure a consistent, stable supply of it.</p>\n<p>At less than 3.1 mmol/L your cholesterol level is low.   While the greater danger lies in having high cholesterol, low levels may compromise your ability to make important compounds like vitamin D, steroid hormones, and bile acids.</p>\n<p>Low cholesterol is associated with violent, aggressive, and impulsive behaviour. It has also been associated with bleeding within the tissue of the brain (primary intracerebral hemorrhage), which typically happens in older adults. It also carries a risk for low birth weight or premature birth in pregnant women.  Since your liver is a source of cholesterol, severe liver disease such as hepatitis and cirrhosis may cause low cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p>If your total cholesterol level is low, tests for ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, serum albumin, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol may help determine why your cholesterol is too low.</p>\n","treatment":"<p>If your cholesterol level is low, should you go out and eat lots of burgers and pizza to increase it? Absolutely not! If it is low because you are on cholesterol-lowering medication, always discuss adjustments to your medication with the prescribing doctor.  If your cholesterol level is low because your good cholesterol (HDL) is too low, we know that exercise helps to boost HDL.  Adding regular physical activity may help to bring your HDL and total cholesterol up.</p>\n<img
